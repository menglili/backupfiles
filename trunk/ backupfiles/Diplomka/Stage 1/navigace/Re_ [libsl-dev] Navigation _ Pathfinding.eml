This really boils down to two questions:

1) Moving along a path to a predefined waypoint

There is an LSL function llMoveToTarget which does this for you and it is presently implemented in OpenSim. Simply set one llMoveToTarget for each waypoint and your object/avatar will follow that path. There is also an event trigger for "got to target" BTW.

2) Avoiding obstacles in the way

This is a MUCH harder problem which has yet to have a general solution! Small obstacles (e.g. a post) can simply be avoided by nudging the avatar randomly. More difficult is a 'U' shaped object which can "trap" the avatar. 

The general case of a maze is a very compute intensive operation - see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_algorithm (original reference published in 1961!). This is one of the fundamental problems of automated design of electronic circuits.

Hope this helps.
