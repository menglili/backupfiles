//A program that accepts an input of type: n v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v6 .... vn and writes out the sum of all vi over n
//Required: n >= 1
/*
*	Basically just implements the following:
*	int sum = 0;
*	for i = 1 to n do
*		sum += read()

TC 0 				//Start with 0 for the sum                

TA 1				//We will use memory address 1 for the for counter
RD					//Reads the n

LAB "start"			//Start of the for cycle
ST					//First, store the new value of the counter (1)

RD					// The code within the for cycle - here
AD					// just read another value and add it to the running sum

TA 1				//Prepare the address for the ST instruction (see 1)

TA 1				//Load the counter value
DR

TC -1				//Decrement the counter value
AD

JNZ "start"			//If counter > 1 jump to the start of the for cycle
ST					//Just write the value of the counter one last time to get rid of it

WR					//Write out the result
