This topic should serve for discussions concerning the data model used by FlowOpt. Its main purpose is to 
help create an API that will allow us to save and load our data to and from the ManOpt database. The model
we have in mind is rather similar to the MAKE data model, however it is not exactly the same, therefore some
conversions may be needed. We have prepared XSD schemas for files that should be used to communicate our data to and from
the MAKE database. Up-to-date version of this schema may be found here. There are currently two schemas - 
one for the workflow editor, one for the schedule visualiser. The former is merely a subset of the latter.

Semantics of the FlowOpt data model - workflows
For the workflow editor module, the key data object will be a workflow. A workflow has a defined ID and name.
