Hi,

We have implemented A* and Artificial Potential Fields for Second Life.
The package is IP protected and we can't provide the sources, but if there
is enough interest we could release the library for testing.

Regards,
Anton.

Hi everyone<br>
<br>
I went through the documentation and mailing lists trying to find the best =
way<br>
to make my avatar move between locations and evade obstacles, but I still c=
an&#39;t<br>
get it right - could someone please throw some ideas at me about how I coul=
d<br>
implement pathfinding / navigation? Say I have two points A and B, how coul=
d I<br>
make the avatar get from one to another while avoiding any obstacles? The m=
ore<br>
reliable the better.<br>
Ideally, I&#39;d like to somehow construct a set of &quot;waypoints&quot; f=
rom from the Sim&#39;s<br>
geometry, create a graph based on accessibility between them and perform<br=
>
something like A* on it. Could this be done? Is there even a way to access =
the<br>
Sim&#39;s entire geometry (like the primitives&#39; shapes and sizes)?<br>
Any thoughts/hints are welcome<br>
<br>
Thanks for all your time<br>
V.Rovensky<br>
