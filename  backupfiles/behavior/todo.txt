* static passanger with routes, check that they make it through (accessibility)
* one pass waiting (PassangerSpawner)
* station capacities
* trains on one track going in opposing directions take turns
* check that all trains are alive w. progress (count how many trains moved, when == trainCount then progress)
* no train capacities - reasoning: statistics, average case, not worst case...
* time slices
